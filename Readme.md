## 🎯 Project Overview

Students often prepare for exams without knowing whether they are truly ready.  
Most learning platforms provide the same revision material to all students, ignoring
individual strengths, weaknesses, and consistency.

This project builds an **AI-based exam readiness prediction system** that:
- Analyzes student mock test performance  
- Predicts exam readiness level  
- Recommends personalized revision strategies  

The system helps students focus on the right areas and improve exam outcomes.
