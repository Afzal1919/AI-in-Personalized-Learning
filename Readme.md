# 🎯 AI-Based Exam Readiness Prediction & Personalized Revision Planning System

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of **Module E – IIT Ropar (Minor in Artificial Intelligence)**  
under the track **AI in Personalized Learning**.

The system analyzes student preparation indicators such as:

- Average mock test score  
- Topic-wise accuracy  
- Revision frequency  
- Preparation consistency  

Using these inputs, the AI model predicts the learner’s **exam readiness level**:

- **Ready**
- **Needs Revision**
- **High Risk**

Based on the predicted readiness level, the system recommends a **personalized revision strategy** to help students prepare efficiently and reduce exam failure risk.

A **fully interactive web application** is also provided using **Streamlit**.
